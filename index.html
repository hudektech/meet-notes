      <h6 id="v-0.0.15.6" class="pt-1">Version 0.0.15.6</h6>
      <ul> <span class="text-success">Features</span>
        <li>The headline message on the "Meet" tab shows the version number. Version 0.0.15.6 is the first version to
          show
          this,
          which will help in user support if I know exactly what version you are using. All versions are globally
          updated
          but occasionally there is a delay. This headline message will also alert the user that the version has
          changed.
        </li>
        <li>New section for Open Rooms for Google Classroom. The process for opening the rooms in standard Google Meet
          is
          different than for Google Classroom, so to make this process cleaner and easier for users, a new section
          Google
          Classroom is added</li>
        <li>The "Choose Course" section in the Meet tab shows the selected course and number of breakout rooms
          requested.
          This allows the user at a glance to see what course they are manaing and the number of breakouts they
          selected/li>
      </ul>

      <ul> <span class="text-danger">Known Issues and Workarounds</span>
        <li>
          For Google Classroom users, please delete the "?authuser=0" suffix of the URL for the GC
          automatically generated Meet. After you delete the suffix, the URL should be in the format:
          https://meet.google.com/abc-def-ghi. This is a bug on my side and I will fix it in the next release. I have
          a matching problem in the "Assign Participants" section if the suffix exist in the GC automatically created
          Meet URL.
          This is only a problem for release 0.0.15.6. I will fix it in the next release.
        </li>
        <li>You will need to select (again) the course name and select (again) the number of breakouts. Even though the
          name is to the right of the dropdown, please select it again. </li>
        <li>Verion 15.6 deleted the user's extension data. This is an error on my part and should not happen again. For
          the next several weeks at least, please back up your extension data by going to the "Course" tab and Export
          your data to your personal computer download folder. If need be, you can Import it back in again. I'm very
          sorry for any inconvenience this caused. This should not happen again, but to be on the safe side please use
          this backup method.</li>
      </ul>

      <h6 id="v-0.0.15.7" class="pt-1">Version 0.0.15.7</h6>
      <ul> <span class="text-success">Features</span>
        <li>Fixed the bug for Google Classroom users where they must delete the "?authuser=0" suffix in the GC
          automatically
          generated link URL. Now please do not do that anymore. That was just a
          temporary workaround until this version's fix </li>
        <li>Fixed the bug in the Meet tab where the user needed to re-select the course. Now you don't have to do
          that. For Course selected, what you see is what you selected, which is how it is supposed to be. However,
          there
          still is
          the lingering problem (fixed in 15.8) where you will need to re-select the number of rooms, please see the
          Known Issues and Workaround below</li>
        <li>Fixed the intermittent error for the "Choose Course" section label in the "Meet" tab where the
          section label did not always accurately reflect
          the Course chosen and the selected number of Breakouts Rooms.</li>
        <li>Added a link to this version release notes web page in the headline message in "Meet" tab where the version
          is
          specified. There is a click "here"
          link which takes the user to this Version Notes page. This is the quickest way to
          learn
          about new features in the latest version. Also if a problem occurs, I will post the error and a workaround if
          possible
          for that
          error while I am fixing it or waiting for Google to approve the new release</li>
        <li>Packaged up the Room Participant Controls into its own section in the Meet tab. This simplified the look of
          the control panel
          by reducing the number of buttons at the top of the panel. These participant controls still exist and work the
          same, however, they are in their own section "{Room Name} Room Participant Controls"</li>
      </ul>
      <ul> <span class="text-danger">Known Issues and Workarounds</span>
        <li>Error: Clicking on the Open Breakout Rooms button in the Meet tab opens all the breakout rooms for a given
          course. For example,
          even though the dropdown may
          select 3 breakout
          rooms and the total number of breakout rooms is 8, the extension will open all 8. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>Workaround is to re-select
            the number of breakout rooms. So even though the selected number is 3, please select it again. After
            re-selecting it, now the Open Breakout Rooms button will only open the requested number which is 3 in the
            example above. This is an
            error that I will fix in the next release, however, this workaround will handle this error. Just select
            again
            the number of breakout rooms. </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <ul> <span class="text-success">Features</span>
        <li>Fixed the bug in the Meet tab where the user needed to re-select the number of breakout rooms. Now you do
          not need to do that.</li>
        <li>Resize button at the top right hand side of the control panel. This minimizes and maximizes the control
          panel</li>
        <li>Resize button at the top right hand side of the control panel, just to the left of the Resize button. This
          retiles all of the rooms as if they were created at the same time, sized and spaced appropriately

      <h6 id="v-0.0.15.9" class="pt-1">Version 0.0.15.9 </h6>
      <ul> <span class="text-success">Features</span>
        <li><span class="red">Automatic Meet Links!!!</span> Now all the links can be automatically generated.
          There is no need to go to Google
          Calendar anymore. Just name your rooms and save, then the links will be automatically created and saved in the
          extension. This is a HUGE time saver</li>
        <li>If you want to save a particular link, for example the main room, you can save that link and it will not be
          changed. All you have to do is leave it alone and it will not be overwritten. However, if you want to refresh
          a new set of links for existing rooms, then blank out the links field and click save. A new set of links will
          automatically be created and saved.</li>
        <li><span class="red">Rooms can now be any resource you want</span>, such as a youtube video, jamboard, a
          math or science web page, or an
          article on the web you want to discuss. Simply copy that link to the Rooms tab and give the "Room" a name.
          Make sure that it begins with https:// or http:// in order to be viewed as a valid link. These resources will
          be tiled and available for retile along with the Google meet rooms on your screen</li>
        <li>Google Classroom users will still need to copy their GC auto generated main page URL to the Rooms tab Main
          room in order to sync the extension with Google Classroom. However, all of the GC breakout rooms links can be
          automatically generated. Just leave the Link field blank and the extension will create the link and save it
          for you in the list.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul> <span class="text-danger">Known Issues and Workarounds</span>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Problem with Auto Link Generation:</span> When you receive the update 15.9
          you may have to verify your google
          account. I experienced this problem and received an error message from the extension: Error
          in automatically creating the link. Please make sure you are logged in to your teaching google account.... No
          need to panic, please type in the following url: <a
            href="https://meet.google.com/new">https://meet.google.com/new</a> . Next the system
          will ask you to
          verify
          your account. Once you do that you are all good! This needs to be initialized once by going to this url and
          following the instructions to confirm your account. After than it should work in the automated mode within the
          extension.</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Noisy Feedback when Using Broadcast:</span> This can happen when students
          are in both the
          breakout rooms and also
          the main room. I fixed this already in version 16.0 which will be available August 19 (estimated). In the
          meantime, the workaround is to *** manually *** turn off the speaker button in the main room when
          broadcasting. I know this breaks the "rule" I gave everyone to please only use the control panel, but this is
          a
          temporary workaround until 16.0 When you turn on the Broadcast microphone it will automatically turn on the
          microphone everywhere so before you speak please turn off the mic in the main rooom (directly in its window).
          This is a temporary workaround and in 16.0 the broadcast will only affect the breakout rooms</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Sync Google Classroom Main room with the extension is inconvenient:</span>
          This
          will be more
          automated by only
          having to
          click on a button to sync up
          the room, and it is laid out as step 2 in the process within the extension so you may easily know what to do
          and when to click. So as of version 16.0 no more highlighting the
          URL,
          copy/paste in the
          rooms tab. Just click a button. Details in the help
          for version 16.0 when it becomes available</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Meets ALWAYS automatically force me to Join:</span> This is also fixed in
          version 16.0
          There will be two checkboxes
          in the settings to control this for the main room and also breakouts. This will be explained in the version
          16.0 help video once version 16.0 is released (estimated August 19)</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Retile for Google Classroom Main room restarts that room:</span> I already
          fixed this in my development version of version 16.0. This will smoothly retile all rooms with no restarting.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- // version 16.0 -->
      <h6 id="v-0.0.16.0" class="pt-1">Version 0.0.16.0</h6>
      <ul> <span class="text-success">Features</span>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Picture background for the Slider and Broadcast sections</span> This is
          controlled in the settings where you may
          choose an URL image link as your background. Additionally you can control the position, size, text color and
          background matte color if the image size is Contain and there is some blank space on the background</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Auto Join Meet is Configureable in the Settings: </span>There are two
          checkboxes, one each for the main rooms and
          one for the
          breakouts. If these are checked, then the respective room type (main or breakout) will automatically be
          joined. Otherwise, it will open the window but wait for you to click Join</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Re-Tile Google Classrooms:</span> Now this is a smooth process and it does
          not
          automatically restart the window</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Google Classroom Sync is just a Click:</span> In the "Start Class with Google
          Classroom", there is a button to
          automatically sync up the extension with Google Classroom. Just click it and you are in sync. No need to copy
          the url and paste it in the Rooms tab. This button does all that for you</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Broadcast is now only to Breakouts:</span> There was a feedback issue when
          the broadcast to breakouts also
          broadcast to the main room. Now broadcast only broadcasts into the breakouts. If you also want to broadcast
          into the Main room then you may also directly click on the Main room microphone (and video) to broadcat there
          as well</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Automatically create new links for rooms when they are opened:</span> This is
          a
          configureable setting for the main room and the breakout rooms. There is one checkbox for Main rooms and one
          checkbox
          for Breakout rooms, because in some cases the main room link should be static but the breakouts links
          should be
          dynamically created
          each time. If checked on, then a brand new
          room link will be created when the teacher opens the room. This is creating new room links "on the fly". After
          defining the room names in the Rooms tab, if this checkbox is on (separate checkbox for main and breakout
          categories)
          then a new room link will be created whenever that room is opened. With this checkbox on, there will be no
          need
          to go to the Rooms tab to blank out the room if the teacher wants a new link, because a new link will be
          created automatically whenever the room is opened.</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Remove All Participants from All Breakouts:</span> Now you can with a click
          of a button remove all participants from all breakout rooms. This will not remove students from the main room,
          just from ALL of the breakouts. If you want students removed from the main room then you can use the single
          room button option just above the Remove All from All Breakouts.</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">The Close Room button is removed because it is redundant and slightly
            problematic:</span> This button is the same as directly closing the window and it occasionally causes some
          microphone issues. Since this has no functionality over the normal close and it occasionally causes problems
          it is removed. The process is still the same. First remove students then close the room just like you close
          down any window. You can even use a command/control W on that window to close it after you first removed the
          students</li>
      </ul>

      <ul> <span class="text-danger">Known Issues and Workarounds</span>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Feedback when Broadcasting: </span> The speaker button is on for all the
          breakouts when you first turn on the microphone. In the next version I will make sure that when the broadcast
          microphone is turned on all the breakout rooms speakers will be turned off. WORKAROUND: Before you turn on the
          microphone, please toggle the broadcast speaker button until you see all the breakout rooms speakers turn off.
          Then you can turn on the broadcast microphone. I will fix this in the next version which I will upload to
          Google by August 23 or so.</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Remove All Participants from All Rooms button does not work properly if there
            are "resource" room(s)
            opened.</span>
          Resource rooms are any non-meet rooms that are defined in the list of your rooms in the extension. An
          example of a resource
          room is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy. I
          fixed this in version 16.1 but the workaround is to go to the rooms tab on the extension and move all the
          resources to the bottom of the list of rooms. You can do this step while all the rooms are still open, go to
          the
          rooms tab and rearrange the order and save. Now you can
          click on the Remove
          All Participants from All Rooms button. If you never define any resources in the rooms list then you will not
          have this problem in v16.0</li>

        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Control Panel scrollbar</span> Added a verical scrollbar on the control panel
          so teachers can move it up and
          down on their smartboards. This should work properly now on smartboards for scrolling, but if not then
          please contact me and let me know</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Broadcast speaker off</span> Automatically initially turns off the speaker
          for
          all breakouts when the
          teacher uses the broadcast microphone to all breakouts</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Fixed Remove All Participants from All Breakouts with there is a Resource
            room</span> Resource rooms are any non-meet rooms that are defined in the list of your rooms in the

          work properly for all breakout rooms even when there is a resource in the middle</li>

      <ul> <span class="text-danger">Known Issues and Workarounds</span>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Computer Slow and Latency Issue</span> I found an area where I can consume
          fewer resources when running the extension. That is fixed in version 16.2 and I hope that solves the latency
          problem. </li>

          back to

          fixed it on my development system and will send it up tomorrow. The problem is that there is an unnecessary
          1/2
          second delay in the speaker button. I removed this speaker button delay and will send up version 16.6
          tomorrow (9/15).
          I think
          this
          speaker
          button problem will finally be put to rest tomorrow in version 16.6. In my testing, if you are only turning on
          the speaker button,
          you
          can go crazy on the slider, grabbing the yellow dot and swinging it back and forth. The meets all keep up and
          there is no out of sync problems. Finally can fully use the slider and grab the yellow dot moving it back

          This was inadverdantly added in 16.5 and I'm sorry for the inconvenience it caused everyone. Upgrades should
          not cause any data loss, however, just to be on the safe side I advise everyone to regularly use the export

          <li>Speaker button disappears on breakouts and audio bleed between rooms. This is because of a Google Meet
            update which broke my extension. Sometimes when Google changes their interface it causes my extension to
            loose it's connection to Google Meet because extensions work on top of the underlying program. If the
            underlying program changes then the extension needs to be adjusted for this change. I fixed this in version
            18.2 which I hope will be approved by Monday
            or Tuesday, December 13 or 14. I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may cause</li>

          <li>Problems with echo. This is due to a mixed environment where google has both a
            new and old interface which causes problems for the extension to hook onto properly. The old and new
            interface may look identical to the user but inside they changed tags which I need to match in order to work
            properly. I just updated the new version 18.5 and uploaded it today, Monday 1/10 and Google usually takes
            one day or so to approve, so it should be available sometime Tuesday 1/11 or Wednesday 1/12. Sorry for the
            invconvenience. Thank you to all the teachers who let me know of this
